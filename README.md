# Helio Mesh Project - Solar Sail Hybrid System

This project develops a modular solar sail system designed for fuel-free spacecraft propulsion by harnessing sunlight. The system features ultra-thin, reflective sails supported by retractable poles that dynamically adjust via a Reinforcement Learning (RL) controller.

The RL algorithm optimizes sail deployment using real-time data on solar radiation and structural conditions to maximize thrust and ensure safety. By integrating NASAâ€™s OMNI 2 space weather dataset, the system predicts solar wind and magnetic field fluctuations, enabling proactive adjustments for enhanced mission reliability.

Its modular design allows adaptation to various satellite configurations and retrofitting onto satellites already in orbit, ensuring versatility.
